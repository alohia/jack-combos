This repository hosts a small web application for generating combinations from selected numbers. The site lives in the `docs/` folder so it can be served with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Use the **System selection** dropdown to choose how many numbers to pick (from 7
to 35). After filling out the subsequent number selectors, pressing **GO**
displays every 7-number combination of the chosen values.

## Running locally
Open `docs/index.html` in your browser. No build step is required.

## GitHub Pages
Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings and select the `docs/` directory as the source. After a few minutes your site will be available at:
```
https://<username>.github.io/jack-combos/
```
Replace `<username>` with your GitHub user name.
